Steps to use it
------------------

1. In source (solaris), first create a directory and copy the 2 attached files into it

2. Modify xtt.properties to add the following
    
    a. sbtlibparms -- this is the SBT library information of the target rman, since the file is going to be same in target and source its better to
        create the file in source and copy it over. This SBT parms will be used by target to perform the restore
    
    sbtlibparms="SBT_LIBRARY=/home/oracle/arun/libra.so, ENV=(RA_WALLET='location=file:/u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0.2/dbhome_1/dbs/zdlra credential_alias=scaz15ingest-scan1:1521/zdlra9')"

    b. resparallel -- how many restore/recover rman sessions can run in parallel. If none is defined default is 3

        resparallel=4

    c. ttsnames -- the list of tablespaces within single quotes that needs to be transported

        ttsnames='TBSSZ1','TBSSZ2'

3. The script needs a temporary directory to generate few files, so set a temp directory

    export TMPDIR /tmp

    The script will create a subdirectory inside that and use that for creating temporary files [e.g. /tmp/ramigratedb]

4. cd to the directory where the 2 files are copied and run setuprestore

    perl dbmigusera.pl  --sqlra 'rasys/ra@scaz15ingest-scan1:1521/zdlra9:dedicated' --sqlsys '/ as sysdba' --setuprestore 

    The sqlra is the connect string to the RA catalog owner
    The sqlsys is the sqlplus connect string to source database, if not provided defaults to '/ as sysdba'

5. The above will generate a file called res.txt, copy that /tmp//ramigratedb/res.txt to target tmpdir

6. In target follow steps 1 and copy over modified xtt.properties and perl script to directory. This directory should not be same as 
    temp directory

7. Repeat step 3 in target

8. Perform restore

    perl dbmigusera.pl --rmanra='rauser11/welcome1@scaz15ingest-scan1:1521/zdlra9' --restore

    rmanra is connect string to connect to catalog in RA

    e.g. rman target / catalog rman/rman@inst2 ... so rmanra = rman/rman@inst2

9. Go back to source and setuprecover

    perl dbmigusera.pl  --sqlra 'rasys/ra@scaz15ingest-scan1:1521/zdlra9:dedicated' --sqlsys '/ as sysdba' --setuprecover

10. This will create a file rec.txt, copy it over just like step 5

11. In target perform recover

    perl dbmigusera.pl --rmanra='rauser11/welcome1@scaz15ingest-scan1:1521/zdlra9' --recover

12. In source make the TBS's read only and repeat step 9 and 10

13. In target repeat step 11

14. In source expdp metadata [export]

15. In target impdp metadata [import]
